  - Ah, you have found me. Someone at last.
  - Listen, don't be afraid. There is a way to get out of this situation. #See it
    as a test.
  - There are portals nearby which only I can control.
  - In order to go on with your usual life, I want you to bring me my 5 things I
    lost a some time ago.
  - I need my Book with my collected knowledge, two of my potions, an ancient coin
    and a crystal for one of my rituals.
  - Unfortunately, I am too old. Hence, I must rely on you.
  - Sounds easy doesn't it? I have unlocked a portal for you. You can find it left
    from here.
  - But be careful...# We are not alone in these woods. There is a monster nearby!
  - However, it is only able to track you every 10 seconds and chasing the spot it
    suspects you in. So if you see it coming, you have some time to get away from
    it.
  - If it gets close to you, it will start hunting! So just don't end up in a dead
    end or else you're dead meat.
  - After you have collected all 5 objects, a portal back to here will open in the
    forest.
  - Also, your torch will decrease in intensity every ten seconds.
  - But you can reignite it by holding the right mouse button.
  - Good Luck!
